Clone this repository to your local device or download the index.html file directly.
```bash

```

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

You will see a page with links to different social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn).

Click on the link of the social media platform where you want to log in or view your profile.

## üé® Customization
You can customize this project as follows:

Open the index.html file in a code editor or any text editor.

For each social media platform, you will find a link that looks like this:

```html
<a href="{{SOCIAL_MEDIA_URL}}" target="_blank">Social Media</a>
```

Replace SOCIAL_MEDIA_URL with the actual URL of your profile on that social media platform.

You can change the text "Social Media" inside the <a></a> tags to reflect the name of the social media platform.

Save the changes.

Open the modified file in your browser to ensure that the links work correctly and take you to your social media profiles.
